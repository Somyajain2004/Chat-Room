# Chat-Room

A simple real-time chat application built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.IO**. It allows multiple users to chat with each other in real-time through a web interface. Users can enter a display name and see live messages from all connected clients, along with message history.

## How It Works (Brief)

- Users visit the site and are prompted to enter a display name
- When they type and send a message, it's sent via Socket.IO to the server
- The server broadcasts that message to all connected clients
- Message history is stored in-memory and sent to newly joined users
- No login/signup required â€” everything happens in real time via sockets
